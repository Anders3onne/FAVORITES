 <p>Butterflies are beautiful, flying insects with large scaly wings. Like all insects, they have six jointed legs, 3 body parts, a pair of antennae, compound eyes, and 
    an exoskeleton. The three body parts are the head, thorax (the chest), and abdomen (the tail end). The butterfly's body is covered by tiny sensory hairs</p>
 <p>Its life cycle is made of this 4 parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Egg</li>
    <li>Larva (caterpillars)</li>
    <li>pupa (chrysalis)</li>
    <li>adult</li>
  </ul>
<p>Butterflies attach their eggs to leaves with a special glue. Butterflies often have brightly coloured wings with unique patterns made up of tiny scales.</p>
